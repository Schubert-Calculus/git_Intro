This is intended to be a bare-bones introduction to git. It will allow one 
to quickly pick up just enough about git to be able to contribute to the 
github project. 


* Installing git

If you are on your office computer, you probably already have git on your 
machine. You can confirm this by opening your terminal window and typing 
"which git" to display the path where it is installed. For your personal 
computers, there are instructions for each operating system found here:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git


* Basic commands

text written in <pointed brackets> is a description for what should be written there

git clone <repository url>
	clones the repository to your directory

git pull origin
	updates the files in your directory to the most recent version on the repository
	ALWAYS pull from github before making any changes to ensure you are working with
		the most recent version of our files

git status
	checks if there are any changes on your computer that are not reflected in the repository
	e.g. have you added your changes? have you committed them?

git add <file>
	stages the specified file to reflect the changes you have made

git rm <file>
	stages removing the specified file

git commit -m "<comment here>"
	readies changes you made via add and rm (see above) for updating github
	the comment is required and will be posted in the git history for reference
	be sure to write a comment that summarizes what changes you made

git push origin master
	this command will submit everything you committed above and update github



* Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through the above commands using the git_Intro repository to familiarize
yourself with the process. The commands below are assuming you use command line git. Commands that
should be typed are written in 'single quotations'.

1) Create a folder on your desktop named Schubert-Calculus

2) Open a console window and navigate to the Schubert-Calculus folder

3) Type the command 'git clone https://github.com/Schubert-Calculus/git_Intro'

4) Your Schubert-Calculus folder should now have a folder inside of it called git_Intro. Open up a
text editor and write 'Hello World'. Save the file as '<my_name>_tutorial.txt' in your git_Intro
folder, then exit the text editor.

5) Back in your console window, move to the git_Intro folder. Type 'git status'. You will see that
you have made changes to the git_Intro folder that haven't been uploaded yet.

6) Type 'git add <my_name>_tutorial.txt'. 

7) Type 'git commit -m "Adding my tutorial file"'

8) Type 'git push origin master'. You will likely be asked for your github username and password
after this command.

9) Refresh your github page and you will see your tutorial file is now in the git_Intro folder in the
Schubert-Calculus project. This file isn't actually useful to our project, so let's remove it.

10) In your console window, make sure you are in the git_Intro folder then type 
'git pull master'. This will make sure that all of the files on your computer are up to date with 
the files in the repository. THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE DONE TO YOUR FOLDERS BEFORE EDITING ANY FILE!!!

11) Go back into your git_Intro folder and delete the file named <my_name>_tutorial.txt

12) In your console window, move back to the git_Intro folder and type 'git rm <my_name>_tutorial.txt'.

13) Type 'git commit -m "Deleting my tutorial file"'

14) Type 'git push origin master'. Once again, you will be asked for your github username and password after this command.

15) Refresh the github page and you should find your tutorial document is now gone.
